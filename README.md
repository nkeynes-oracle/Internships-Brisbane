This repo holds internships coming up in Brisbane, aimed
towards the 'summer' period of 2016/2017.

## Contributing
All internships are held as MarkDown files in the /\_Internships/
directory. See the /\_Internships/Tanda.md file for an example.

### MarkDown Requirements
All 'internship' files require the following fields:

  - 1x H1 Title
  - 1x H2 Preamble Section, which requires at least:
    - @company
    - @location
    - @commence
    - @applicationDue
    - @link (THIS IS A MARKDOWN LINK)
  1x H2 Description Section

### How to Contribute
Contributions can be made as a pull request to this repo.
I plan on hopefully having a CI service set up to just
check if the information was valid. I'll get around to it...

### Project Management
Currently using GitHub Projects. There's a tab at the top
of the repo that you can click to add issues to
Projects, stories, etc.

### Testing
Tests can be run using Ruby via running `rake test` in the
WebServer directory.

## Becoming a Main Contributor
Just ask, and I'm sure I'd just add you directly to the repo to
make changes.

## ToDo
  - [ ] Add more internships
  - [ ] Write a Wiki
  - [ ] Serve /\_Internships/ directory as cool web portal, probs
