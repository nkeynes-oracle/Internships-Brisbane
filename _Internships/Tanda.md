## Description
Brisbane's fastest growing start-up company is now taking applications for our 2016/17 Summer Internship.

This is a great opportunity to see what it's like to work at a fast growing tech company. You’ll be working in our Brisbane office, building and launching a new app. By the end of the internship our goal is to have 5000 people using the app you built.

To do this you'll collecting feedback from thousands of customers and tens of thousands of users, then throwing in a sprinkle of your best judgement and the advice of the rest of our team to build the best app you can. Once it’s built you’ll be launching it and using customer feedback to iterate on it, shipping improvements daily.
