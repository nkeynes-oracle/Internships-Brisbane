## Description
Polymathian in partnership with The University of Queensland and Queensland University of Technology offers scholarships over the Christmas period to students studying the sciences.

In previous years students have come from mathematics, computer science and physics faculties.

Scholars get to work on a combination of a specific research and development project as well as gaining exposure to currently running Polymathian projects.
